# Password Generator Starter Code

## Summary

// Attempting my very best knowledge to what I have learned in Javascript, I used inputs provided by the user to generate a random password by using their criteria for the password characters.

// Does check conditions as to what characters will be included, such as upper case, lower case, numerals and special characters.

// There is to be a function to generate the password based on the preferences.

// Utilizes the event listener when "Generate Password" is clicked, prompts follow to ask the user what they would like to result in the new password.
